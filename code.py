Hi Sathish, I checked the workflow and Terraform code. Terraform supports dev/qa/uat/preprod/prod, but the NPE workflow matrix only includes DEV, QA, UAT and the workspace is taken from GitHub Environment variable TF_WORKSPACE_NAME. There is currently no preprod entry in the workflow, so preprod won’t run unless we add it (and create GitHub Environment PREPROD with its TF_WORKSPACE_NAME + secrets). If preprod is supposed to be part of NPE, we need to confirm which workspace it should map to; otherwise we should explicitly add PREPROD in the workflow matrix and configure its env vars/secrets.
